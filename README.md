# Node-RED module

https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-connio

A collection of Node-RED nodes to communicate with the Connio platform. The first group of nodes (Connio Edge) allows you to bi-directionally communicate with the platform from your devices and gateways. You can use these nodes from a Node-RED instance installed within your device. The second group (Connio Cloud) allows you to connect external services to the platform to consume device data and send device commands easily.
